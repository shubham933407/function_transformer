This project applies function transformation techniques to preprocess data and explores two supervised learning models — Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier — to perform classification tasks. The objective is to evaluate and compare model performance after transforming features to improve separability.

🛠️ Project Highlights
📌 Feature Engineering: Applied mathematical function transformations (e.g., log, square, square root) to enhance the predictive power of features.

🧪 Model Training: Trained and evaluated both:

Logistic Regression — linear decision boundary

Decision Tree Classifier — non-linear, interpretable model

📈 Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy score

Function-based feature transformation

Model training & evaluation

📊 Example Transformations
Feature scaling using MinMaxScaler

Applying transformations such as:

log(x + 1)

sqrt(x)

x^2

These are especially useful when raw features are not linearly separable or skewed.
